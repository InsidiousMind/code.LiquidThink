My Beautiful (coding) subsite.
---

This is the source of [code.liquidthink.net](http://code.liquidthink.net), a site where I share my current or recent adventures of everything programming and Computer Science related. This will significantly unclutter LiquidThink and create clearer goals and niches for each sites.

Here, I post on basically...just programming. Python, C, C++, Java, hell even Assembly. Anything that i'm really doing, or am planning to do, is going on this site :) This will also include my portfolio and past history with coding, since I think it would be a great way to map my progress.

A little about me... I am interested in everything programming, hacking, or Lovecraft (probably a bit too much for my own good). This blog is about all theoretical nerdy-geeky stuff to do with technology. If youâ€™re more into technical nerdy stuff, check out The Cyber Cult my other blog! If you want to know more, you can head over to my About Page.
